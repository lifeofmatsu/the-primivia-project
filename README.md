# the-primivia-project
Primivia, an amateur game aimed at capturing the simplicity and mechanics of a fighting game (格闘ゲーム). This game was adapted from and built off of Chris Courses' "JavaScript Fighting Game Tutorial with HTML Canvas" YouTube tutorial (https://youtu.be/vyqbNFMDRGQ?si=Q_h1SGHpXq5Mn5Bm).
